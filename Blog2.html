          <li>can you become the cricketer by only watching cricket?</li>
          <li>can you become the writer by only reading answers?</li>
          <li>can you build up muscles by only looking someone doing workout?</li>
          <li>can you become the actor by only watching acting?</li>
          <li>can you become the programmer by only watching someone writing code?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
        <p>
          By only watching and observing you will learn something but not much so for learning anything you need to play that game either it is coding, any sport or anything.
        </p>
          <p>so implement those things which you are learning either it’s small or big it doesn’t matter but make something.</p>
