          Let us first clarify the question. There is not any easy way to become
          good at anything but there is an efficient way to do everything. Let
          us try to understand the difference between easy and efficient here
          with the help of a programming question! Consider the problem of
          “Searching an element in a sorted array“.
        </p>
        <p>
          Person A solves the above problem by using Linear Search algorithm.
          Person B solves the above problem by using Binary Search algorithm.
        </p>
          <p>So, person A here solved the problem in an easy way yet Person B
          solved the problem in an efficient way. Now, the efficient way of
          learning Data Structures and Algorithms depends on a several factors:</p>

          <p>1.Your prior knowledge of programming languages and basic DS and Algos.<br>
          2.The purpose for which you want to learn it.<br>3.The resources available to
          you. A perfect guide!</p>
