          Person A solves the above problem by using Linear Search algorithm.
          Person B solves the above problem by using Binary Search algorithm.
        </p>
          <p>So, person A here solved the problem in an easy way yet Person B
          solved the problem in an efficient way. Now, the efficient way of
          learning Data Structures and Algorithms depends on a several factors:</p>

          <p>1.Your prior knowledge of programming languages and basic DS and Algos.<br>
          2.The purpose for which you want to learn it.<br>3.The resources available to
          you. A perfect guide!</p>
